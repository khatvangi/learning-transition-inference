"""
synthetic_learners.py — generate synthetic learning trajectories

creates trajectories with KNOWN ground-truth transition types,
so the inference module can be validated: does it recover what
we put in?

four learner types:
  1. GRADUAL: smooth sigmoid improvement
  2. ABRUPT: flat → sudden jump → plateau (single changepoint)
  3. FALSE_AHA: performance gain without subjective transition marker
  4. NON_LEARNER: stays near chance
  5. UNSTABLE: oscillates between states

each generator produces:
  - accuracy series
  - optional confidence series (correlated with accuracy)
  - optional RT series (inversely correlated with accuracy)
  - optional transfer series (persistent or decaying)
  - ground truth labels
