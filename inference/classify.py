classify.py — classify learners into transition types

uses model comparison + changepoint detection + Ψ analysis
to assign each learner to one of:

  ABRUPT:    single clear transition, changepoint model wins, Ψ spike
  GRADUAL:   smooth improvement, continuous model wins
  UNSTABLE:  multiple state switches, HMM model wins
  NON_LEARNER: no improvement, flat performance
  MIXED:     ambiguous — models disagree or evidence is weak
